Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
Background
In 2016, Cyclistic (a hypothetical company) launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are 
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things 
possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes 
are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
